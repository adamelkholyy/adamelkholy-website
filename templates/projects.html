    <h2>Model Attention in CNNs for Image Classification of
        AI-Generated and Human-Made Artwork</h2>
    <p>
        The recent rise in the popularity and prevalence of Artificially Intelligent (AI) generated art
        presents certain challenges for human artists. With continued public discourse surrounding the
        negative impacts of AI-generated art, human artists are concerned regarding the threat posed to
        their market share, businesses and livelihoods. The efficiency of AI artwork generation models
        is such that human artists cannot compete in terms of work-rate and recent studies suggest
        that humans are unable to differentiate between AI-generated and human-made works. We
        introduce an empirical method of distinction between AI-generated and human-made artworks
        via a Machine Learning (ML) approach and endeavour to determine the defining differences
        between the two classes by conducting an in depth analysis of model attention. We develop a
        classification model through use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture so as
        to achieve our aims and create our own labelled dataset for supervised training, made publicly
        available for use in future research. We conduct experiments on network architecture, dataset
        augmentation and hyperparameter tuning to produce a highly accurate and highly generalisable
        model. Our final model achieves an accuracy of over 96% on the test set with an F1 score of
        over 0.97. We conclude with an in depth investigation into model attention and propose our
        own novel theory of classification along with an explanation of the defining differences between
        AI-generated and human-made artworks. <br>

    <h2>Super Mario Bros Reinforcement Learning Report</h2>
    <p>
        Super Mario Bros Gym is an environment designed for 
        compatibility with the OpenAI Gym framework. This project aims to develop an agent capable of
        completing the levels of the eponymous Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game by comparing
        a variety of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. For this implementation, environment states
        are either processed frames from the framebuffer of the game emulator or a vector of features (such
        as Marioâ€™s position and score). The reward function provides rewards based on how far rightwards
        Mario has moved. In this report we experiment with the following RL models: Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), Prioritised Experience Replay (PER), 
        Dueling Network architecture, 
        Noisy Network architecture, 
        Distributional Network architecture and 
        N-Step learning updates.

    <h2>IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Report</h2>
    <p>
        Sentiment analysis poses a useful and technically challenging task in the field of Natural Language
        Processing. In this report we investigate the leading methods of sentiment analysis using a dataset
        of 4000 IMDB movie reviews, sorted into positive and negative classes based
        on their numerical rating. We evaluate different techniques of feature extraction as well as
        differing model architectures in order to determine the highest performing approach. We develop
        our own classification models for comparison with the existing sklearn implementations and
        compare the metrics of each (accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score). Our implementation of the 
        Guassian Naive Bayes model ultimately outperforms the existing sklearn implementation across all performance metrics. <br>
